# Random Shaders from Early 2019
I wrote a bunch of shaders while working through
*The Book of Shaders* and while obsessing over IQ's blog.
The shaders contained here are a small, small subset
of all the shaders I wrote; they're mainly focused on ray-marching.
Sadly a lot of the other work I did was lost to the sands of time,
but there are still a few gems here.

These shaders largely follow the conventions of glslCanvas.
*The Book of Shaders*'s [editor](editor.http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/)
is a great way to get started.

Shaders are arranged chronologically, marked `shader-00` - `13`.
There are also three unknown shaders (which were done later), marked `unknown-00` - `02`.

If you're curious, the Mandelbulb implementation used here was the precursor
to the one used in Keikan.
I'd also like to point out that the stylistic conventions used for the code
in this projects are non-existantâ€”These files are just snapshots of cool stuff I made
as I was messing around,
so there isn't really a polished version of anything, so to speak.
All the shaders here *should* be functional.
